# Smart-Irrigation-using-IoT

The Smart irrigation System has wide scope to automate the complete irrigation 
system. Here we are building a IoT based Irrigation System using ESP8266 
NodeMCU Module. It will not only automatically irrigate the water based on 
the moisture level in the soil but also send the Data to ThingSpeak Server to 
keep track of the land condition. The System consists of  a water pump which 
will be used to sprinkle water on the land depending upon the moisture condition.
